        <p>
            Unlike many outdoor sports, getting started with bouldering is surprisingly simple. All you need are some climbing shoes, chalk, and a positive attitude—most gyms even rent the equipment for your first sessions. <strong>No prior experience or complex gear required!</strong>

                    Before you start climbing, learn proper falling technique and always check your landing zone. Taking basic safety precautions and learning gym etiquette will help ensure a fun and injury-free experience.
