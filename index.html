                    What is Bouldering?

                <p>
                    Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. 
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Unlike traditional climbing bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.
